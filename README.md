# Website-4b-Dunkin-Divers-mobile
A third year college group project  


#### Third-Year college website project built with jQuery mobile :mortar_board: :three:  

This was a group project between myself and a college classmate - [Szabolcs Kovacs] (https://github.com/SabiKov)  
The sections I was responsible for included:  
- Home page layout and general site styling
- Photos page, including the flickr api calls
- Map page, with the code to generate map and directions from the google api  

The sections created by Szabolcs:  
- Blog page with Drupal blog integration
- Video page with youtube api link-included
- Social media pop-up and connections

> This website was built as an introduction to using ajax technologies  
> It uses a mobile platform to interact with various web-based api's, namely:
> * _flickr_ api for the website photo gallery
> * _youtube_ api for the website video feeds
> * _google maps_ js-api for the map and directions page
> * The website also makes use of jQuery with a customised theme to give a uniform style to the site.  

### Website hosted on [daragh.co/mobile] (http://daragh.co/mobile/index.html)
* Note: If a mobile device is used to view the 'Dunkin Diver' main webpage,  
it will be re-directed to this mobile version of the site.  
The main 'Dunkin-Diver' was a seperate project and has it's own github repo.
